# rhymepy-web-new
 A rewrite of [rhymepy-web](https://github.com/ZeyadAmr/rhymepy-web) by [ZeyadAmr](https://github.com/ZeyadAmr) in python using pyscript. I plan on tweaking the code to make the rhyme detection better (with splitting of syllables and maybe some other stuff). I know python better than I know javascript so that's why I rewrote the project.
